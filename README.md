Hi Github community, this is the repository of the Arduino's code. We're using Arduino only to control the stepper motors. The idea is to receive an array of letters to represent turning on/off motors.

## IMPORTANT
Please remember to add to arduino libraries the folder of WordReprensenter. For more information of adding Arduino's libraries please check --> https://www.arduino.cc/en/hacking/libraries
