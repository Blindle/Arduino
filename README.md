# Arduino's code 
Hi Github community, this is the repository of the Arduino's code. We're using Arduino only to control the stepper motors. The idea is to receive an array of letters to represent turning on/off motors.

### Libraries used:
- [HashMap](https://playground.arduino.cc/Code/HashMap)

### Installing libraries in Arduino:
- Put the HashMap folder in "hardware\libraries\".
- In the Arduino IDE, create a new sketch (or open one) and select from the menubar "Sketch->Import Library->HashMap".
- Once the library is imported, an '#include <HashMap.h>' line will appear at the top of your Sketch.
